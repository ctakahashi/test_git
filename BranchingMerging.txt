So this is how I do:

Basically, work in your branch. Code, code, change, change, yay you're done.
Then you gotta commit those changes to your branch, TEST, as usual.
After that, you can finally merge yoru branch with the master.

1. push changes to your branch called "test"
git add . // or "git add FILENAME.EXT"
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin test

2. merge branch with master
git checkout master // move into master branch
git pull origin master
git merge test
git push origin master
